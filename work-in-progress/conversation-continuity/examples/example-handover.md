## Decisions Made This Session

### Decision 1: Hybrid Storage with YAML
**Decision:** Use hybrid storage - critical facts in project memory, detailed info in YAML knowledge base file  
**Rationale:** Balances memory efficiency with comprehensive context preservation. YAML format allows machine-readable structure while remaining human-readable.  
**Impact:** Information routing decisions required for all stored data  
**Confidence:** High  
**Date:** 2025-10-30T14:00:00Z

### Decision 2: Structured Knowledge Base Categories
**Decision:** Implement five main categories: questions_answered, decisions, capabilities, conflicts_resolved, context_snapshots  
**Rationale:** Covers all aspects of conversation continuity with clear separation of concerns  
**Impact:** All conversation data fits into defined structure  
**Confidence:** High  
**Date:** 2025-10-30T14:15:00Z

### Decision 3: Memory Score Formula
**Decision:** Use formula (messages * 1) + (tool_calls * 2) with thresholds at 50 (warn) and 70 (critical)  
**Rationale:** Tool calls are more memory-intensive than simple messages. Thresholds provide early warning.  
**Impact:** Proactive handover preparation before memory issues  
**Confidence:** Medium (may need adjustment based on real usage)  
**Date:** 2025-10-30T13:00:00Z

### Decision 4: Markdown with YAML Frontmatter for Handovers
**Decision:** Use Markdown for handover body with YAML frontmatter for metadata  
**Rationale:** Human-readable format with structured metadata. Aligns with versioning standards.  
**Impact:** Consistent handover format across all conversations  
**Confidence:** High  
**Date:** 2025-10-30T14:00:00Z

### Decision 5: Automatic Lightweight Startup Checks
**Decision:** Run capability checks automatically at conversation start, but silently unless issues detected  
**Rationale:** Ensures context is fresh without being intrusive  
**Impact:** Every conversation starts with current capability status  
**Confidence:** High  
**Date:** 2025-10-30T12:30:00Z

### Q2: Should handovers be automatic or manual?
**Answer:** Hybrid approach - automatic at thresholds, manual trigger available  
**Category:** workflow  
**Asked:** 1 time  
**Recorded In:** Design decisions in SKILL.md

### Q3: How to handle conflicts between instructions and practice?
**Answer:** Flag conflict with suggestion, ask before updating instructions, log resolution

## Context for Next Conversation

### Essential Background

The conversation-continuity skill is designed to solve a critical problem: losing context between conversations with Claude. Currently, when memory fills up or a conversation ends, the next conversation starts fresh without awareness of previous work, decisions, or questions answered. This forces users to repeat information and re-establish context.

The skill implements a multi-layered approach to continuity: project memory stores immediate essentials (current task, active files), a YAML knowledge base maintains comprehensive history (questions, decisions, capabilities, conflicts, snapshots), and handover documents provide complete context for conversation transitions. The system tracks memory pressure using message and tool call counts, warns proactively, and prepares handovers before hitting critical limits.

The design follows the skill-creator framework with SKILL.md as the main documentation, reference files for detailed schemas and templates, and helper scripts for calculations and initialization. The skill operates in hybrid mode - running lightweight checks at conversation start and providing full capabilities via manual triggers.

### Mental Model

Think of the skill as a "conversation continuity layer" that sits between individual conversations. It acts like a project manager who takes detailed notes, tracks decisions, remembers what questions have been asked, monitors progress, and prepares comprehensive handoff documents when the current session ends. The knowledge base is the long-term memory, project memory is the working memory, and handover documents are the formal transition briefings.

### Key Constraints
- Knowledge base must be YAML format for machine readability
- Project memory limited to ~500 words
- Memory score thresholds: warn at 50, critical at 70
- All file operations on macOS must use OSAScript or MCP Filesystem tools
- Skill must follow skill-creator framework structure

### Assumptions Made
- Memory score formula (messages * 1 + tool_calls * 2) is reasonable approximation
- Thresholds at 50/70 provide adequate warning time
- YAML structure covers all necessary information categories
- Users will appreciate proactive warnings rather than silent operation
- Handover documents in Markdown format are preferred

## Next Steps (Priority Order)

### Immediate Actions (Start Here)
1. **Test skill with real conversation scenario**
   - Context: Need to validate that the skill works as designed in actual usage
   - Approach: Start a new conversation, load this handover, verify all components work
   - Dependencies: This handover document, knowledge base if created
   - Estimated effort: 30-45 minutes

2. **Create initial knowledge base for project**
   - Context: Project doesn't have knowledge base yet, need one for continuity
   - Approach: Use conversation_helper.py to initialize or manually create from template
   - Dependencies: None
   - Estimated effort: 15 minutes

### Follow-Up Actions
3. **Validate knowledge base structure with real data**
   - Context: Ensure schema accommodates actual usage patterns
   - Dependencies: Knowledge base created, some usage data

4. **Move skill to completed directory if successful**
   - Context: Once tested and validated, skill is ready for production use
   - Dependencies: Testing complete, any issues resolved

### Future Considerations
- May need to adjust memory score thresholds based on real usage patterns
- Could add automated archiving of old knowledge base entries
- Might want to create visualization tools for knowledge base statistics
- Consider integration with project management tools for task tracking

   - Priority: Medium
   - Impact: User experience - automatic is convenient but may be unexpected
   - Options: A) Auto-create, B) Prompt user, C) Require manual creation

2. **What should happen if knowledge base file is corrupted or invalid?**
   - Priority: Low
   - Impact: Error handling strategy
   - Options: A) Recreate from scratch, B) Try to recover, C) Fail with error message

### Technical Unknowns Requiring Research
None currently - all technical approaches are validated

## Conversation Metrics

| Metric | Value | Threshold | Status |
|--------|-------|-----------|--------|
| Messages | 35 | 45 (critical) | ⚠️ Warning |
| Tool Calls | 18 | 20 (critical) | ⚠️ Warning |
| Memory Score | 71 | 70 (critical) | ⚠️ Critical |
| Duration | 90 min | N/A | ℹ️ Info |

**Recommendation:** Continue in new conversation to maintain performance. Memory score is at critical threshold.

---

## Handover Checklist

Before continuing in new conversation:

- [x] Handover file created and saved
- [ ] Knowledge base updated with snapshot (not created yet - will initialize in next conversation)
- [ ] Project memory updated with handover location (will do in next conversation)
- [x] All file changes committed/saved
- [x] Next steps clearly defined
- [x] Blockers documented (none current)
- [x] Open questions listed with priorities
- [x] Context complete and self-contained

---

## How to Continue

### In New Conversation:
```
Load handover: /Users/colin/Projects/claude-skill-passing/work-in-progress/conversation-continuity/examples/example-handover.md

[Claude will read this handover file and immediately continue work with full context]
```

### What Claude Will Do:
1. Read this handover document completely
2. Check for knowledge base (create if missing)
3. Verify tool capabilities
4. Review file locations and states
5. Understand current task and next steps
6. Test the conversation-continuity skill with real usage
7. Initialize knowledge base for the project
8. Continue work seamlessly from where we left off
