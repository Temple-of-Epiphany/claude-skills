# Context Continuity Skill

## Overview

This skill enables Claude to maintain persistent context across conversation boundaries, preventing information loss and repetitive questions. It establishes a systematic approach for storing, retrieving, and transitioning information between conversations through intelligent routing, proactive monitoring, and seamless handover preparation.

## When to Use This Skill

Trigger this skill in these scenarios:

**On conversation start:**
- When beginning work on an existing project
- When user references past conversations or work
- When loading a project with established context

**During conversation:**
- When memory usage approaches 80% capacity
- When asked to update project memory or instructions
- When project instructions conflict with current work
- When same information is requested multiple times
- When user asks about available tools or capabilities

**On conversation end:**
- When proactively preparing handover for next conversation
- When creating continuation notes

## First-Run Configuration

On first use with a project, ask these configuration questions:

**Artifact Storage Preference:**
"Where should I save completed artifacts? Options:
1. Project Files (accessible only within this project)
2. Filesystem at [project directory path] (accessible system-wide)
3. Ask each time

Default is option 2 (filesystem). Your preference?"

**Versioning Approach:**
"For file updates, should I:
1. Maintain same filename with internal version number and changelog
2. Create new files with version suffix (e.g., document_v2.md)

Default is option 1 (internal versioning). Your preference?"

Store these preferences in project memory immediately after receiving answers.

## Core Workflow

### 1. Initial Conversation Setup

At conversation start, perform these checks:

**Check available tools and capabilities:**
- List all available tools using tool inspection
- Identify which MCP servers are connected
- Note any tool limitations or missing capabilities
- Store this inventory in session context

**Verify storage locations:**
- Check if working in project vs standalone conversation
- Verify filesystem access and allowed directories
- Determine if bash_tool access is available (workspace vs local)
- Store location context in project memory

**Load existing context:**
- Read project memory for current task and state
- Check for continuation notes from previous conversations
- Review recent project instruction updates
- Load persistent project notes

### 2. Information Routing Decision Matrix

When processing new information, route it to appropriate storage:

**Project Memory** (use memory_user_edits tool):
- Current task and immediate objectives
- Active file paths (both filesystem and workspace)
- Session state and progress markers
- Tool/capability inventory for current session
- User preferences (artifact location, versioning style)
- Recently answered questions (to prevent duplicates)

**Project Files** (workspace artifacts):
- Working documents and drafts
- Intermediate analysis results
- Temporary outputs not yet finalized
- Artifacts being iteratively developed

**Filesystem** (permanent storage):
- Completed deliverables
- Final artifacts user requested to save
- Documentation and reference materials
- Scripts and reusable code
- Project templates and standards

**Project Instructions** (update PROJECT_INSTRUCTIONS.md):
- Permanent project configuration
- Coding standards and conventions
- Workflow preferences
- Directory structure definitions
- Tool usage guidelines
- Communication standards

### 3. Memory Usage Monitoring

Track approximate memory usage throughout conversation:

**Calculate usage indicators:**
- Length of conversation history (message count)
- Cumulative token usage if available
- Number of tool calls and results loaded
- Size of artifacts in context

**At 80% threshold, automatically:**
1. Create handover document with:
   - Current task state and progress
   - Key decisions made this conversation
   - Pending work items
   - Important context for continuation
   - File locations and paths used
   - Tool/capability notes relevant to next session

2. Save handover to filesystem at: `[project-dir]/handover-notes/handover-[timestamp].md`

3. Update project memory with:
   - Pointer to handover document
   - Brief status summary
   - Next conversation starting point

4. Inform user: "Approaching conversation limit. Created handover document at [path] to ensure seamless continuation."

### 4. Duplicate Question Prevention

Maintain question log in project memory:

**Track answered questions:**
- Store hash of question topic/intent
- Note where answer is stored
- Mark timestamp of response

**On information request:**
1. Check if similar question answered recently
2. If duplicate detected:
   - Point to existing answer location
   - Ask if user wants updated information
   - Only re-answer if explicitly requested

**Clear question log:**
- After project phase transitions
- When user explicitly requests reset
- On major project changes

### 5. Project Instruction Conflict Detection

Monitor for conflicts between project instructions and work:

**Detect conflicts when:**
- User requests approach contradicting instructions
- Current work repeatedly violates instruction patterns
- Multiple clarifications needed on same instruction topic
- New requirements emerge not covered by instructions

**On conflict detection:**
1. Pause current work
2. State the specific conflict clearly
3. Ask: "This conflicts with project instructions at [section]. Should I:
   - Update project instructions to reflect new approach
   - Follow existing instructions
   - Create exception for this case"
4. Implement user's choice
5. Update relevant documentation

### 6. Tool and Capability Tracking

At conversation start and when tools are used:

**Inventory available tools:**
- MCP servers connected (filesystem, PDF, browser, etc.)
- Container vs. local filesystem access
- Special capabilities (code execution, web search, etc.)

**Track tool behavior patterns:**
- Which operations succeed/fail
- Tool limitations encountered
- Workarounds discovered

**Store in project memory:**
- Current tool availability summary
- Known limitations for this project
- Preferred tools for common operations

**Use for guidance:**
- Select appropriate tools for requests
- Avoid attempting operations with unavailable tools
- Suggest missing tools when needed

## Information Storage Patterns

### Storing Project Notes

Create persistent notes at: `[project-dir]/docs/project-notes.md`

Include:
- Frequently needed information
- Answers to recurring questions
- Important project context
- Key decisions and rationale
- Common workflows and procedures

Update notes when:
- New important information discovered
- Workflow patterns emerge
- User provides critical context
- Solutions to common problems found

### Tracking Current Task

In project memory, always maintain:
```
Current Task: [Brief description]
Task Status: [Not started | In progress | Blocked | Completed]
Working Files: [List of active file paths]
Next Steps: [Immediate next actions]
Blockers: [Any impediments]
```

Update this after each significant work unit.

### Maintaining File Registry

In project memory, track:
```
Filesystem Artifacts:
- /path/to/file.ext - [Purpose] - [Last updated]

Workspace Artifacts:
- /workspace/path/file.ext - [Purpose] - [Status]

Note: Workspace artifacts reset between container sessions
```

### Versioning Approach

Based on user preference stored in project memory:

**Internal versioning (default):**
```markdown
**Version:** 1.2.3
**Author:** Colin Bitterfield
**Email:** colin@bitterfield.com
**Date Created:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Date Updated:** YYYY-MM-DD

## Changelog
- **1.2.3** (YYYY-MM-DD): Description of changes
- **1.2.2** (YYYY-MM-DD): Previous changes
```

**Filename versioning (if preferred):**
- document_v1.md â†’ document_v2.md
- Keep previous versions for reference
- Note version progression in project notes

## Handover Document Template

When creating handover at 80% memory threshold:

```markdown
# Conversation Handover
**Created:** [Timestamp]
**Conversation ID:** [If available]
**Project:** [Project name]

## Current Task State
[Description of what was being worked on]

## Progress Summary
- [Completed items]
- [In-progress items]
- [Not yet started]

## Key Decisions Made
1. [Decision with rationale]
2. [Decision with rationale]

## Important Context
[Critical information for next conversation to understand]

## File Locations
**Filesystem:**
- [Path]: [Purpose]

**Workspace:**
- [Path]: [Purpose, note if needs recreation]

## Tool/Capability Notes
- Available: [Tools that were working]
- Issues: [Any tool limitations encountered]
- Workarounds: [Solutions discovered]

## Next Steps
1. [Immediate next action]
2. [Subsequent actions]

## Blockers/Issues
[Any impediments to be aware of]

## Questions to Clarify
[Items needing user input]
```

## Best Practices

**Be proactive, not reactive:**
- Don't wait for user to ask about saving information
- Monitor memory usage continuously
- Create handovers before reaching limits
- Update project memory frequently

**Keep project memory lean:**
- Store pointers to detailed information, not the information itself
- Use filesystem for large content
- Keep only immediately relevant context in memory
- Clean up stale information

**Maintain clear boundaries:**
- Project memory: Ephemeral session state
- Project files: Working artifacts
- Filesystem: Permanent deliverables
- Project instructions: Configuration standards

**Prevent information loss:**
- Save critical decisions immediately
- Document important discoveries
- Track all file locations
- Create continuation notes liberally

**Avoid redundancy:**
- Check for duplicate questions before answering
- Point to existing information when available
- Consolidate repeated information
- Update existing docs rather than creating new ones

## Error Handling

**If project memory operations fail:**
- Fall back to filesystem storage in project notes
- Inform user of fallback approach
- Continue work without blocking on memory updates

**If filesystem access unavailable:**
- Use workspace artifacts with clear warnings
- Document that files won't persist
- Suggest enabling filesystem access

**If approaching token limits:**
- Immediately create handover document
- Compress information to essentials
- Provide clear continuation instructions
- Update project memory with status

**If conflicting information found:**
- Pause and highlight conflict
- Ask for clarification
- Don't make assumptions
- Document resolution in project notes

## Integration with Project Workflow

This skill coordinates with standard project practices:

**Complements project instructions:**
- Enforces standards defined in instructions
- Detects when instructions need updates
- Implements versioning per instruction preferences

**Supports memory system:**
- Uses memory_user_edits tool for session state
- Stores ephemeral context appropriately
- Avoids overloading memory with permanent data

**Enables tool ecosystems:**
- Tracks which MCP servers available
- Guides appropriate tool selection
- Documents tool behavior patterns

**Facilitates collaboration:**
- Creates clear handover documentation
- Maintains project notes for reference
- Tracks decisions and rationale

## Usage Examples

**Example 1: Starting a new conversation**
```
Claude (internal): Conversation starting, checking context...
- Loading project memory: Current task is "Develop PDF processing skill"
- Tool check: Filesystem, PDF Tools, Docling available
- Loading handover note from /Users/colin/Projects/claude-skill-passing/handover-notes/handover-2025-10-30-14-30.md
- Ready to continue work

Claude: Continuing work on the PDF processing skill. Last session completed the text extraction module. Ready to work on the form filling component next?
```

**Example 2: Routing information**
```
User: Remember that I prefer using pytest over unittest for testing.

Claude (internal): This is a project-level preference.
- Not immediate task state â†’ not project memory
- Not a working artifact â†’ not project files
- Permanent standard â†’ belongs in project instructions

Claude: I've updated your project instructions to reflect the pytest preference for all testing. This will be consistently applied across all work in this project.
```

**Example 3: Approaching memory limit**
```
Claude (internal): Memory usage at 82%, triggering handover preparation...

Claude: I'm approaching the conversation limit. I've created a handover document at /Users/colin/Projects/claude-skill-passing/handover-notes/handover-2025-10-30-16-45.md with our current progress on the authentication module, key decisions about JWT implementation, and next steps for token refresh logic. The next conversation can pick up seamlessly from there.
```

**Example 4: Duplicate question detection**
```
User: What's the project directory structure again?

Claude (internal): Checking project memory... this was answered 15 messages ago and directory structure documented in project notes.

Claude: The directory structure is documented in /Users/colin/Projects/claude-skill-passing/docs/project-notes.md (see "Directory Structure" section). Would you like me to show it again, or is the existing documentation sufficient?
```

**Example 5: Instruction conflict detection**
```
User: Create a README.md file to document this skill.

Claude: This conflicts with project instructions section "File Header Standards" which states skills should only contain SKILL.md without additional documentation files like README.md. Should I:
1. Update project instructions to allow README files for skills
2. Follow existing instructions (no README)
3. Create README as exception for this specific case

What would you prefer?
```
