## 5. Handover Examples

### Example 1: Skill Development Session

```markdown
# Conversation Handover

**Created:** 2025-10-30 14:45
**Project:** Claude Skill Development
**Conversation ID:** [ID if available]
**Estimated Capacity:** 83%

---

## Current Task

**Task:** Developing context-continuity skill for conversation handovers

**Status:** In Progress (70% complete)

**Progress:** Completed SKILL.md and two reference files. Working on third reference file (handover templates).

**Last Action Taken:** Created memory-monitoring.md reference file with detailed capacity tracking strategies.

---

## Progress Summary

### Completed This Session
- Created project directory structure at /Users/colin/Projects/claude-skill-passing/work-in-progress/context-continuity/
- Wrote SKILL.md (v1.0.0) with comprehensive skill instructions
- Created storage-decisions.md reference with decision trees
- Created memory-monitoring.md reference with capacity tracking
- Implemented proper versioning and headers

### In Progress
- Creating handover-templates.md reference file (currently 60% done)
- Need to add examples section
- Need to add best practices section

### Not Yet Started
- Testing the skill with real usage
- Creating example handover documents
- Packaging the skill into .skill file

---

## Key Decisions Made

1. **Skill structure approach**
   - Decision: Use progressive disclosure with references for detailed content
   - Rationale: Keep SKILL.md under 500 lines as recommended by skill-creator
   - Impact: More maintainable, easier to navigate

2. **Storage routing strategy**
   - Decision: Four-tier system (memory/files/filesystem/instructions)
   - Rationale: Clear boundaries prevent confusion
   - Impact: Systematic approach to information management

3. **Memory threshold**
   - Decision: Trigger handover at 80% estimated capacity
   - Rationale: Leave room for handover creation itself
   - Impact: Prevents mid-handover capacity issues

---

## Important Context

User (Colin) wants seamless conversation continuity to avoid repetitive questions and lost context. The skill addresses this by:

1. Routing information to appropriate storage
2. Monitoring memory usage
3. Creating handover documents
4. Tracking tools and files
5. Detecting duplicate questions

Key requirement: The skill should ask configuration questions on first run (artifact storage location, versioning preference) and store answers in project memory.

### Technical Context
Skill follows skill-creator framework with SKILL.md and references/ directory. Using progressive disclosure pattern to keep main skill file concise.

### Discoveries
- MCP Filesystem tools have restricted directory access
- Bash tool needed for reading /mnt/skills documentation
- Skill-creator provides excellent patterns in references/

---

## File Locations

### Filesystem (Persistent)
- `/Users/colin/Projects/claude-skill-passing/work-in-progress/context-continuity/SKILL.md` - Main skill file, complete v1.0.0
- `/Users/colin/Projects/claude-skill-passing/work-in-progress/context-continuity/references/storage-decisions.md` - Complete v1.0.0
- `/Users/colin/Projects/claude-skill-passing/work-in-progress/context-continuity/references/memory-monitoring.md` - Complete v1.0.0
- `/Users/colin/Projects/claude-skill-passing/work-in-progress/context-continuity/references/handover-templates.md` - IN PROGRESS (60%)

### Created Directories
- `/Users/colin/Projects/claude-skill-passing/work-in-progress/context-continuity/`
- `/Users/colin/Projects/claude-skill-passing/work-in-progress/context-continuity/scripts/` (empty, may not be needed)
- `/Users/colin/Projects/claude-skill-passing/work-in-progress/context-continuity/references/`

---

## Tool and Capability Notes

### Available Tools
- Filesystem:write_file, read_file, create_directory - Working well
- bash_tool - Used to read /mnt/skills documentation
- memory_user_edits - Available but not yet used

### Successful Patterns
- Using Filesystem tools for local macOS work (per project preferences)
- Reading skill-creator documentation from /mnt/skills
- Following semantic versioning standards

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate Next Actions
1. Complete handover-templates.md reference file
   - Finish examples section (add 2-3 more examples)
   - Add best practices section
   - Add template selection guidance
2. Review all three reference files for consistency
3. Test skill by applying it to current conversation

### Upcoming Tasks
- Create example handover documents
- Package skill using scripts/package_skill.py
- Test with real projects
- Iterate based on usage

---

## Notes for Next Conversation

The skill is well-structured and nearly complete. Main SKILL.md provides overview and workflow, while three reference files provide detailed guidance:

1. storage-decisions.md - When to use which storage location
2. memory-monitoring.md - How to track and respond to capacity
3. handover-templates.md - Templates for creating handovers (IN PROGRESS)

The skill follows all project instructions (headers, versioning, changelog). User prefers direct communication without excessive validation.

When continuing:
- Finish handover-templates.md (add remaining examples and best practices)
- Review the complete skill for consistency
- Test the skill by creating a handover for THIS conversation
- Consider creating a working example handover document

## 6. Best Practices

### Creating Effective Handovers

**Be specific about state:**
- Not: "Working on authentication"
- Yes: "Authentication module 80% complete. Login endpoint working, need to add password reset flow"

**Include actual paths:**
- Not: "Created some files"
- Yes: "Created /Users/colin/Projects/app/src/auth.py and /Users/colin/Projects/app/tests/test_auth.py"

**Explain decisions:**
- Not: "Used JWT tokens"
- Yes: "Used JWT tokens instead of sessions because: stateless, scales better, works with mobile apps"

**Make next steps actionable:**
- Not: "Finish the feature"
- Yes: "Add password reset endpoint (20 min), write tests (15 min), update API docs (10 min)"

**Preserve critical context:**
- Include information that can't be easily rediscovered
- Skip information readily available in files
- Focus on "why" more than "what"

### Template Selection Guide

**Use Standard Template when:**
- Normal workflow with clear progress
- Multiple work items to track
- Some decisions made
- Estimated capacity 70-90%

**Use Quick Template when:**
- Simple, focused task
- Clear next steps
- Minimal context needed
- Capacity approaching limit quickly

**Use Complex Template when:**
- Multi-module project
- Many interdependencies
- Significant architectural decisions
- Need detailed status tracking

**Use Emergency Template when:**
- Suddenly hit capacity limit
- Minimal time for handover
- Need to capture critical info only
- Can reference other documentation

### Common Handover Mistakes

**Mistake 1: Too vague**
```
Bad: "Fixed some bugs and made progress"
Good: "Fixed null pointer exception in data parser (line 147), 
      implemented caching layer (15% performance improvement), 
      refactored database queries (3 files modified)"
```

**Mistake 2: Missing file paths**
```
Bad: "Created the configuration file"
Good: "Created /Users/colin/Projects/app/config/settings.yaml 
      with database credentials and API keys"
```

**Mistake 3: No context for decisions**
```
Bad: "Using PostgreSQL"
Good: "Using PostgreSQL instead of MongoDB because: 
      - Need strong ACID guarantees for transactions
      - Team has PostgreSQL expertise
      - Better integration with existing tools"
```

**Mistake 4: Unclear next steps**
```
Bad: "Continue development"
Good: "Next steps in order:
      1. Add error handling to payment processor (30 min)
      2. Write integration tests (1 hour)
      3. Deploy to staging environment
      4. Wait for user acceptance testing"
```

**Mistake 5: Forgetting tool notes**
```
Bad: [No mention of tools]
Good: "Note: bash_tool can't access local filesystem, 
      used Filesystem:write_file instead. PDF Tools 
      MCP working well for form operations."
```

### Handover Naming Convention

Use consistent timestamp format:

```
handover-YYYYMMDD-HHMM.md

Examples:
handover-20251030-1445.md
handover-20251030-1630.md
handover-20251031-0915.md
```

This allows:
- Chronological sorting
- Easy identification
- No name collisions

### Storage Location

Always store in project's handover-notes directory:

```
/Users/colin/Projects/project-name/handover-notes/

Create if doesn't exist:
Filesystem:create_directory(
    path="/Users/colin/Projects/project-name/handover-notes"
)
```

### Loading Handovers

On conversation start:

1. Check project memory for "Last Handover:" entry
2. If present, read that handover first
3. If absent, list handover-notes directory and load most recent
4. Summarize loaded context to user
5. Confirm direction before continuing
